## Description

Three arcade buttons connected to ESP32, using the ESP32-BLE-Keyboard library to send media key strokes to a bluetooth connected device. 


## Getting Started

* Print the casing. Put the buttons in the casing.
* Connect the arcade buttons to ground and three suitable pins on the ESP.
* Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard) on how to include the ESP BLE keyboard library. 
* Upload the .ino-file to the ESP.

### Dependencies

* ESP32-BLE-Keyboard library
* Instructions on how to use arduino IDE with ESP32 [here.](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#installation-instructions) This step is also included in the BLE keyboard instructions.

### Tips & tricks

* Change the Pin numbers if you use different pins for the buttons (e.g. const int buttonPin1 = 21;)
* Print the button holder face down to avoid using supports. 
* The buttons will (hopefully) show up as "ESP32 Keyboard" among your bluetooth devices.
